But underlying the humor are two teens in transition.In the book Pride and Prejudice we can find many distinctive characters, like Mr. Collins who spared all his effort to please Lady Catherine, an arrogant and selfish lady, Mrs. Collins who got married with somebody she didn't love but who could provide her with a steady life, the wise father Mr. Bennet, the naive and frivolous little girl Lydia and so on. Some people may judge their behaviour or personalities, but in my opinoin, that's every single person's right to choose to be who they want to be. Hope you and me can also find the character we want to act in the movie named life. so she urged Elizebath to marry with him. Elizebath is enough brave to refuse her mother firmly</textarea></div>
